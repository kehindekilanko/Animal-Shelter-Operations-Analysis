# Animal Shelter Operations Analysis 

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes animal shelter operations data to understand
intake trends, outcomes, adoption performance, and live release rates.
The goal is to support operational efficiency and improve animal welfare
through data-driven insights.

---

## 🎯 Business Objectives
- Monitor total animal intake and outcomes
- Track adoption and live release rates over time
- Identify high-risk animal groups with lower adoption rates
- Analyze intake patterns by animal type, age, and jurisdiction
- Support decision-making for shelter capacity and resource allocation

---

## 📊 Key KPIs
- Total Intake: 52,343
- Total Outcome: 51,943
- Live Release Rate: 79.1%
- Adoption Rate: 21.5%
- MoM & YoY performance tracking

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Power BI Desktop
- DAX (MoM, YoY calculations)
- Power Query
- Data Modeling

## 🧠 Key Insights
- Cats and dogs account for the majority of shelter intake
- Younger animals have significantly higher adoption and live release rates
- Older animals (10+ years) show lower adoption rates and longer LOS
- Certain jurisdictions contribute disproportionately to total intake
- Intake volume closely tracks outcome volume, indicating strong throughput

---

## 📌 Recommendations
- Increase targeted adoption campaigns for older animals
- Allocate resources to high-intake jurisdictions
- Expand foster and rescue partnerships to improve live release rates
- Use intake trends for proactive capacity planning
